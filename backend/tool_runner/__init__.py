"""FastAPI-style tool runner for Ada's Home Assistant, memory, and
habit tools.

Layout (tool-runner-split, 2026-10-06): shared module state lives in
common.py; each domain in a mixin module; ToolRunner composes them by
multiple inheritance. backend.tool_runner stays the import path — the
wildcard re-exports every common name so `from backend.tool_runner
import X` and patch("backend.tool_runner.X") keep working.
